# LLM models
- Base models
	- e.g., GPT, LLaMa, BERT, FLAN-T5, PaLM, BLOOM
	- [[Transformer]] architecture
		- scale efficiently
		- parallel process
		- attention to input meaning
- **Prompt and completions**
	- prompt: text you pass to LLM
	- context window
	- model predict / inference
	- completion: output of the model
- Scale is important!!
