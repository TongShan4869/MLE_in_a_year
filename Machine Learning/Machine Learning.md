# Machine leanring definition
- **Definition**
	- Field of study that gives computer the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed - Arthur Samuel
# Machine learning Algorithms
- **[[Supervised learning]]**
	- rapid advancements used most in real-world applications
- **[[Unsupervised learning]]**
- recommender system 
- reinforcement learning

# Terminology
## Training set
- notation
	- $x$ = "input" variable / feature
	- $y$ = "output" variable / "target" variable
	- $m$ = number of training examples
	- $(x, y)$ = single training example
	- $(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$  = $i^{th}$ training example
- input features
- output targets
- training set -> learning algorithm -> $f$ function 
	- $x -> f -> \hat{y}$
	- $\hat{y}$ : y-hat prediction (estimated y)
