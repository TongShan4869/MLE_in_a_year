- grokking: https://github.com/judylime/grokking/tree/main/Grokking%20the%20Machine%20Learning%20Interview
- meta 只考 rec sys
	- **马上反问：我们的business goal是什么？**
		- 指标metric
	- clarify problem scope
		- 多少商品，网页，user？
	- 陈述：经过discussion后，我们的实际问题是
		- given xxx, input is xxx, output is xxx (with length of xxx)
		- if scroll down refresh with new data...
		- this is a **classification problem**
